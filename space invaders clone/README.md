# Space-Invaders-clone
Another small step in my Python learning process.


This is my personal OOP version of the Space Invaders Arcade Game (refactoring after simple script version realized thx to freeCodeCamp.org).
Aliens spawn randomly in the space.
Every alien instance is created into the enemies_list.
