# Pygame-Experiments
Contains tribute versions of Pong and Space Invaders

# WARNING:
These pygame implementations were devoloped with the Python3.x PyGame Library on a MacBook Air 2017 (resolution being 1,440 x 900 pixels) as a **learning** project. On that platform everything worked fine without any particular issue.

With higher resolution machines (eg. MacBook Pro 2020), problems with FPS rate and game speed tend to make the games not enjoyable anymore: the game objects move either too fast or too slow. 
I know I should try to fix this issue but, due to work overload, I don't have enough time right now.
I hope I will come up with a solution as soon as possible.
